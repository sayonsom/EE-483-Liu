# EE-483-Liu
This Repo contains all the codes I wrote for Electrical Distributions System course taught by Professor Chen-Ching Liu at Washington State University in Fall 2016. 

#FAQs
Let me guess what you may be thinking:
## What do I use this for?
For quick computations in MATLAB of line inductance, capacitance, primitive matrix, Kron Reduction, line impedance, voltage regulator tap changing calculations, etc. 
You can use the codes for symmetrical and asymmetrical fault computations as well for distribution systems. 

## How do I use this?
For personal quick computations, and reference if you are already taking EE 483 course or any other course like Electrical Distribution Systems. 

## I am student taking EE 483, or thinking of taking ... Can you send me the homework solutions?
No. I am not sure whether it is legally viable to publish all the homework problems, midterms, and solutions on a public platform. If you have some doubts - the first place to contact should be the TA and the professor. You can also email me at 'sayonsom.ventures@gmail.com', and I may try to help you out.
