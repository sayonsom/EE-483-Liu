Solutions to HW problems are not instructive. It looks like they just state the answer, and does not tell you how the answer has been reached. They are hard to follow later on, if you are looking at the material for future reference in life.
Group learning session was helpful, and field trip was the highlight of the course. 
Learned a lot. Thanks much, Professor and TA!
